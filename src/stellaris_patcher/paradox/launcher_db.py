"""Reads and writes playsets in the Paradox launcher's `launcher-v2.sqlite`.

Reading opens the file with SQLite's `mode=ro`, so it can't change anything.
Writing backs the file up first (decision 6). `write_playset` changes only
the one playset it was given; `replace_playsets` makes the launcher's list
exactly the one it was given. Don't call it while the launcher
is running: the launcher keeps its own copy of the data in memory.
